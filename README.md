#Brytescore Analytics Package and Core Objects

leads and predicting user behaviors. This project includes the core Analytics package, which tracks non-industry specific
actions on websites. It also includes definitions for some core objects accessible from Brytescore API packages.

##Docs

Documentation on this and other packages can be found in the [Brytescore API Docs](http://www.brytecore.com/docs/).
